# Selenium Overwiev
## Part 1 - introduction to selenium automation tool with Python

Welcome to "Introduction to selenium". In this tutorial you will be shown how to use Selenium as web scrapping service.
Selenium is as tool that allows web developers to test their websites/webservices. This framework allows them to go through different scenarios on their websites and tests them automatically. Selenium is also great tool for webscraping. In this tutorial one is able to test selenium on dedicated webserver and try selenium solving some real world problems, like reading data from website that is loaded dynamically (with js/AJAX).


## Part 2 - Start webserver
First thing we want to do is to start webserver for our use. Since platform doesn't allow us to make requests to remote server we prepared our own example webserver to test scrapping on.

To run webserver:
```
python3 server.py
```

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" onclick="runSnippetInTab('http-server', this)">Run http server</button>
